# speedtest-todeath
This script will run speedtest-cli with every single server listed by --list.


#TODO
- Command argument so you can:
  * Clean up.
  * Choose timeout
  * Choose how many server (random select server, base on range somehow).
  
# Bug:
  - Run script 2nd times => git clone again.
  fatal: destination path 'speedtest-cli' already exists and is not an empty directory.
